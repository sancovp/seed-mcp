# SEED MCP

SEED - Unified System Identity for Compound Intelligence

## What It Does

SEED provides a unified interface to compound AI systems. Instead of users juggling multiple tools and frameworks, SEED presents one coherent voice that coordinates everything behind the scenes.

## Current Features

- `who_am_i(context="")` - Returns unified system identity with optional context

## Installation

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

As an MCP server, SEED integrates with Claude Code and other MCP clients to provide unified system awareness.

## Architecture

SEED coordinates between:
- STARLOG (project workflows)
- HEAVEN Framework (agent orchestration) 
- GIINT (multi-fire intelligence)
- Carton (knowledge management)
- PayloadDiscovery (structured sequences)

The goal: Complex internally, simple externally. Many minds, one voice.
